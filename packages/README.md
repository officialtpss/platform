# Populous Platform Common modules

This repo holds the libraries and modules that are common to the public and admin apps.

Docs are in the main application [README](https://github.com/bitpopulous/platform/blob/master/README.md)
and [wiki](https://github.com/bitpopulous/platform/wiki).

### Development

These packages are included in the public and admin apps using [git sub-modules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules).

This means you can `$ cd packages` and use git as normal to push changes.

### Testing

The test runner must be started within the [main Meteor application](https://github.com/bitpopulous/platform)
